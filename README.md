# Heart_Disease
# Prediction of Heart Disease

## Summary

A Jupyter Notebook (`Heart_pred.ipynb`) in this repository uses machine learning methods to predict heart disease. To determine whether a person is at risk or not, the model is trained on a structured dataset that contains a variety of health indicators.

## Dataset

Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other demographic and medical characteristics are included in the dataset. It has been preprocessed to manage feature scaling, categorical variables, and missing values.

## Approach

### Preprocessing Data

In order to get the dataset ready for model training, the data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

### Model Choice

To find the most effective method, a number of classification models were tested, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.

### Metrics for Evaluation

The model's performance was assessed using the F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, and
